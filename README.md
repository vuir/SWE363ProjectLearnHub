# Learn Hub
## Description:
Learn Hub is a university-based initiative designed to enhance and modernize the peer 
tutoring experience. The project aims to connect students who are capable of offering 
academic support with those who need assistance in specific courses, creating a 
structured and accessible system for learning.
Instead of relying on informal or unstructured methods, the platform provides a unified space where learners can:
- Find academic support.
- Explore tutor profiles.
- Schedule tutoring sessions that match their academic needs and availability.
  
Key Features:
- Course-Based Search: Easily find tutors and sessions by course code or subject.
- Tutor Ratings & Reviews: Evaluate tutor performance and choose the best fit.
- Favorites: Save preferred tutors and courses for future sessions.
- Interactive Tools: Tutors can share resources and organize study sessions efficiently.
- Admin Dashboard: Administrators manage tutors, courses, and oversee all activities to maintain system quality.

By centralizing these interactions, Learn Hub ensures a smoother, more reliable tutoring process that saves time and promotes academic success within the university community.
